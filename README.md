# NpTorch
This is a simple deep learning framework inspired by PyTorch and written in python using numpy.<br>

`autograd.py` - A autograd system which implement backpropagation over a model, when called. Supports basic matrix operations and activation functions such as relu, tanh and sigmoid. <br>

`nn.py` - Layer class implementation for different layers used in neural networks. Supports Linear, Sequential, Tanh, Sigmoid, Relu, MSELoss.<br>

`optimizer.py` - Optimizer class for running optimization over network parameters. Support Stochastic Gradient Descent.
